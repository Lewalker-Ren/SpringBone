# SpringBone
This is a modified version of Anim Graph Spring Controller that additionally allows you to limit translation in specific axis and specific directions.

The node is named "Limited Spring Controller".

I originally made this because I wanted to use a spring controller for my character's helmet but didn't want it to be able to clip through his head.

## Installation
If you're on 4.22 and don't want to compile, grab the 4.22 branch.

Clone/download to your project's Plugins directory (you may need to create this, it goes alongside content folder).

Open your project. If you have mismatched engine version it will build. Enable it in the Plugins window in UE4. That's it, now it should be available as a node in the animation graph "Limited Spring Controller"
